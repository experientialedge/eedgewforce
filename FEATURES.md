# EdgeWForce feature guide

## Work together

Open **Projects & team chat** in the sidebar. Every existing role can use it; only invited project members can see a project.

| Feature | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| Shared projects | Create a project, describe its goal, choose a colour and add active colleagues from your company. |
| Project roles | Owners manage the project; owners can appoint leads. Leads can add members and create channels. |
| Team channels | Create separate channels for workstreams. Messages synchronize automatically while the page is open. |
| Threads | Reply to a message without interrupting the main conversation. |
| Mentions | Select a teammate using the composer’s mention menu. They receive a private inbox notice. |
| Message history | Load earlier messages. Search the messages loaded in the current channel. Drafts stay in the current browser tab when switching channels. |
| Shared task board | Assign one task to multiple project members. Move it through To do, In progress, In review and Done. |
| Task scheduling | Set a start, due time, reminder and priority. All scheduling inputs display Africa/Lagos time. |
| Recurring work | Daily and weekly tasks create their next occurrence when completed. Missed intervals are skipped; simultaneous completion requests cannot create duplicate occurrences. |
| Scheduled reminders | Supabase runs the project reminder function every minute, including when the app is closed. Delivery is recorded once per recipient and task. |
| Inbox and notification bell | Task assignments, mentions and reminders appear in the teamspace inbox and the main notification centre. Read state belongs to the recipient. |
| Activity | Task status changes show who changed the work and when. |

The collaboration additions have automated service tests, PostgreSQL transaction/permission tests and browser verification with two independent test users. The UI reports failed saves; collaboration writes are never queued as false successes while offline. Messages are plain text and are not end-to-end encrypted.

## Staff and operations

The existing modules remain available:

- HR staff directory, CSV/Excel import with preview and downloadable first-login credentials, profile editing and account status management.
- Office/work location creation, primary replacement, secondary offices, temporary assignments and assignment history.
- GPS clock-in/out using authoritative Lagos time: morning 08:00–09:00, late morning 09:00–10:00, midday 12:00–13:00 and clock-out 17:00–18:00. A real employee profile and permitted workplace are required. Supervisors can review exceptions.
- Daily schedule planning, supervisor review and HR roster oversight.
- Existing individual tasks, acknowledgement, completion and delivery stages.
- Leave requests and approvals, staff profiles, birthdays, announcements, objectives and key results.
- Inventory and warehouse records, stock movements and low-stock alerts.
- Customer/store directories, field visits, store requests and geofence checks.
- Sales catalogues, orders, collections, settlements and delivery records.
- Executive/HR/supervisor views, organization structure, reporting, audit logs and role-based access.

Automated tests cover these core service workflows. Hosted verification is recorded separately in `RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md`; an empty dashboard is not evidence that every provider integration has been configured.

## Integrations that need separate configuration

Email/WhatsApp delivery, browser push, online payment processing, external AI and biometric verification require their provider configuration and end-to-end acceptance checks. The features are retained, and no claim is made that an unconfigured provider has delivered a message, charged a payment or verified a face. Existing individual-task background email/WhatsApp delivery uses the worker; the new Supabase schedule handles project in-app reminders.

Passwords are never committed to source. A separate administrator is explicitly provisioned using `server/scripts/createAdministrator.js`; existing administrator accounts are not reset or replaced.

## Staff activity and HR review

- Authenticated active staff profiles report app interaction counts every 30 seconds. No typed text, screenshots, camera, device applications or operating-system activity are collected.
- After 600 seconds without observed interaction, the server records one flag per inactivity period. A Supabase job checks every minute, including when browsers are suspended or closed. The notification bell refreshes every 30 seconds.
- Recent heartbeats distinguish app inactivity from an unconfirmed lost connection. Activity in any signed-in tab counts, and returning closes the open period without deleting its history.
- HR/HR_MANAGER users in the same company receive an in-app notice, even without an employee profile. Administrators receive fallback notices if no active HR account exists.
- HR Overview has an activity review queue with explanations, resumed activity, Lagos timestamps, acknowledgement and history. Staff can explain their own events and continue working; review access is limited to authorized company managers.
- Monitoring starts with a signed-in active staff profile and stops on explicit sign-out. It is not limited to clocked-in hours. Closing the browser without signing out can produce a connection-gap flag. A flag is context for human review, not proof that someone stopped working.

## Workstation readiness and sign-in

Staff can sign in using their work email, registered phone number or exact staff ID. Browser sessions keep refreshed tokens synchronized with API calls. HR can assign a workstation while a staff member remains signed in; attendance refreshes every 15 seconds and when reconnecting or returning to the app. Check my workstation verifies GPS proximity without creating attendance. Clocking rechecks the current assignment, permitted Lagos window and GPS before saving; duplicate requests cannot record twice. New workstation forms require the actual pin, GPS capture or entered coordinates. A workstation's display label alone does not grant attendance permission.


## Market security and executive activity brief

Migration 013 adds 300-metre market boundaries, location-gated staff sign-in, confirmed-departure reports, HR/admin dashboard notices, server-side session revocation and assigned-location re-entry. Existing records and features remain. These features require the migration and production activation flags; they are not active merely because the code is deployed.

HR and administrator dashboards include factual attendance, lateness, movement, app activity and shared-task counts, plus evidence-linked executive summaries when an OpenAI provider key and model are configured. Daily factual reports and notices require the Supabase reporting scheduler. See PRODUCTION_SETUP.md for activation and browser-GPS limitations.
